# Bard: An Interactive Concert Finder

Link: https://dkempen98.github.io/concert-finder/

## Description

Search by location and genre and find local concert information with a COVID risk assessment data and the weather forecast displayed as well as a link to purchase tickets.

## Why make it?

Wanted to work as a group to create a tool to find upcoming concert information for your local area. This was also done as an exercise in working with a group and with API's.

The application uses the API's from the following sites:

- Ticket Master: https://developer.ticketmaster.com/
- Open Weather: https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api
- The CDC: https://data.cdc.gov/resource/9mfq-cb36

- CSS 
- JavaScript. 
  -  APIs used alongside JavaScript to display data
